          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello, I'm Javier Rangel, an amateur photographer based in the vibrant city of Mexico City. Since 2018, I have been passionately exploring the world of photography, immersing myself in the art of capturing breathtaking portraits and exotic landscapes.</p>
          <p>My journey began as a way to express my creativity and share my unique perspective with the world. Photography quickly became my preferred medium to freeze fleeting moments in time, allowing them to be cherished and revisited at any given moment. There's a certain magic in capturing the raw emotions, hidden stories, and beauty that surrounds us.</p>
          <p>In addition to my love for photography, I am constantly pushing my creative boundaries by exploring new editing techniques. I believe that post-processing plays a vital role in enhancing the essence of a photograph, allowing me to create unique visual experiences that resonate with the viewer.</p>
          <p>Join me on this artistic journey as I continue to develop my skills, refine my vision, and capture the beauty of the world we live in. Together, let's celebrate life's extraordinary moments and embrace the power of photography to create lasting memories.</p>
          <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoy creating it.</p>
